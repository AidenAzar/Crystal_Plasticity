      Explicit point integration Crystal plastity using
      Busso (1990) flow rule modified by Luscher et al.
      (2013). There are three hardening models:
      1- Asaro and Needleman
      2- Bassani and Wu
      3- Luscher et al.
      User can also define crystal oreintation. 
      It is assumed that total deformation gradient, F,
      is known for each step.
